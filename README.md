<h1>🏔️ Peaks And Adventures - a place for true mountaineers </h1>
<p> <strong>PeaksAndAdventures</strong> is a project written in C#, utilizing ASP.NET Core MVC. Its aim is to provide a platform where every hiking and outdoor enthusiast can find comprehensive information about mountains and related activities. The concept is to enable users to access everything of interest with just one click, allowing them to discover routes and embark on mountain adventures easily. 
Here, we gather professionals and amateurs alike, united by our love for the mountains. PeaksAndAdventures serves not only as a repository of vast information about mountains but also as a platform where we can find guides and agencies organizing expeditions, ranging from easier routes in Bulgaria to some of the most renowned ones worldwide—like those to Everest, K2, and beyond. 
We can verify information about the mountaineers and agencies and decide whether to trust them by signing up for an expedition and entrusting our lives to their hands. 
In addition to everything else, here everyone is free to share their knowledge and experience of mountaineering because we don't divide people here. Everyone is important because this is a place where people with common ideas, interests, hobbies, and ways of life come together. <strong> Our love for nature and the mountains connects us.</strong> </p>
