                Location = "Stara Planina is one of the four physiographic regions of the Old Mountain Zone. It is part of the Alpine-Himalayan mountain system, specifically within the large geological formation known as the Balkanides. Situated between the Fore-Balkans to the north and the Sub-Balkan valleys to the south, it extends to the west along the Targovishte Timok River (a right tributary of the Beli Timok) and the Visochitsa River (Komshitsa, Temska River, right tributary of the Nishava) in Serbia. To the east, it reaches the Black Sea at Cape Emine.\r\n\r\nStara Planina spans parts of 14 Bulgarian provinces: Vidin, Montana, Vratsa, Sofia, Sofia City, Lovech, Plovdiv, Gabrovo, Stara Zagora, Veliko Tarnovo, Sliven, Shumen, Burgas, and Varna.\r\n\r\nThe area of Stara Planina within Bulgaria is 11,596.4 km\u00b2, with a length of 530 km and a width ranging from 15 km in the central part to 50 km in the western and eastern parts. Its average elevation is 722 meters above sea level.",
                Climate = "The climate is moderately continental, with the exception of the eastern parts, which are subject to transitional continental influences.\r\n\r\nThe main Stara Planina mountain range falls under the mountain climate zone. The primary factors shaping the climate are atmospheric circulation, elevation, and the slopes' exposure.\r\n\r\nStara Planina serves as the main climatic barrier and natural border in Bulgaria. The northern foothills exhibit moderately continental climatic characteristics, while the southern ones are transitional. Climate transition is particularly characteristic of the eastern parts of the mountain. From the foothills to the summit, the character and values of climatic elements change. The average annual temperature decreases with elevation, reaching -0.7 \u00b0C at the Botev Peak station (Table 1). Average January temperatures vary widely, from around 0 \u00b0C in the easternmost parts to -5 \u00b0C for the Petrohan station and -9.3 \u00b0C for the Botev Peak station. Average July temperatures range from 8 to 20 \u00b0C, depending on the elevation. Temperature amplitudes are not large, ranging from 16 to 18 \u00b0C.\r\n\r\nPrecipitation increases with elevation, reaching 1200–1400 mm. It is more abundant on the northern slopes, while the southern slopes remain in a precipitation shadow, receiving about 550 mm of precipitation. In the easternmost parts, due to the transitional climate, precipitation reaches about 600 mm. Snow retention is about 4–6 weeks in higher areas and 1–2 weeks in the east. The maximum precipitation occurs in spring, while the minimum is in winter, with seasonal equalization of precipitation in the eastern parts. The windiest places in Bulgaria are the peaks of Murgash and Botev, where the average annual wind speed reaches 10 m/s. The northern foothills of Stara Planina are characterized by foehn phenomena, while the region of Tvarditsa and Sliven experiences the cold descending wind known as \"bora\" (often called \"Sliven wind\"). Adverse climatic phenomena include fog, temperature inversions in basins, and icy conditions.",
                Waters = "\r\nStara Planina gives rise to several significant rivers in Bulgaria, including Lom, Ogosta, Nishava, Malki Iskar, Vit, Osam, Vidima, Rositsa, Yantra, Stryama, Tundzha, Luda Kamchiya, and others. A substantial part of Bulgaria's river drainage is formed in this mountain range. The rivers exhibit characteristics of rain-snow, snow-rain, rain (especially in the eastern part), and karstic recharge (rivers Nishava, Iskretska River, Kotlenska River, Leva River, etc.). In the high-altitude areas, the peak of runoff occurs in May, while in the lower areas it is in April for the northern slope and March for the southern slope. In the Ludogorie River basin, the maximum is in February. Two tectonic lakes are also located here: \"Lokvata\" under Golyam Kupen in the Central Stara Planina and Skalenskoto in the Stidovska Planina.\r\n\r\nThe runoff module in the Stara Planina region shows significant diversity. It is higher in the high-altitude zone on the northern windward slopes (above 25 l/s/km\u00b2), where precipitation is more significant, snow retention is greater, and evaporation is less pronounced. Additionally, the maximum runoff is influenced by the impermeable geological foundation and the steep relief. In the lower zone, the runoff module is significantly smaller (10 l/s/km\u00b2), where lower precipitation amounts, less pronounced snow retention, and stronger evaporation greatly reduce its magnitude. In the lowest parts of Stara Planina, the module varies between 3 and 5 l/s/km\u00b2, and these values are due to low precipitation amounts, significant evaporation, substantial infiltration into the permeable geological foundation, and the slight slope of the relief.\r\n\r\nAmong the reservoirs, the largest is the Kamchiya Dam, built on the Ludog Kamchiya River. The rock composition characteristics allow the formation of significant amounts of fissure underground waters. The developed karst processes are also the cause of numerous karst springs. Some of the largest karst springs here are the Iskrets Springs, Zhitolyub near the Lakatnik station, the Opitsvet spring at the foot of Chepan and Mala Planina, the Kotelski springs, while the most famous mineral springs are in Vurshets, Bursiya (Berkovsko), Neshkovtsi (Troyansko), and others.\r\n\r\nNotable waterfalls include Raynskoto Praskalo (the highest permanent waterfall on the Balkan Peninsula), Golyam Dzhendemski Waterfall, Vidimskoto, Kademliyskoto, Babskoto, Karlovsko Praskalo, and others. The Vratsa Waterfall near Vratsa is the largest intermittent waterfall in the Balkans.",
                Flora = " Up to about 800 meters above sea level, broadleaf species prevail, mainly oak and hornbeam, above which is the belt of beech forests. In many places, it is the beech that forms the upper limit of the forest. Above the beech forests, in certain locations, there are beautiful spruce forests, sometimes mixed with fir (Berkovska and Kalofer mountain). Additionally, limited areas of forests of whitebeam (Teteven region) and black pine exist. On the northern slopes of Berkovska Stara Planina, there are natural groves of the relict common chestnut. In Central Stara Planina, on karst terrains, one can find the edelweiss (in the area of Kozata Stena and Mazalat peak).\r\n\r\nThe highest parts are covered with meadows and pastures. Among the shrub species, rosehip, hawthorn, blackberry, buckthorn, hazel, juniper, blueberry, heather, blackthorn, wild pear, wild plum, and others are widespread. In certain sections of Central and Western Stara Planina, heath communities are preserved. In the region of Aytos, the endemic Aytos grabiche can be found, while in the central parts of the mountain, the endemic Stara Planina pine is present. West of Sliven is the northernmost location of the Mediterranean species, kuckuch. There is a significant diversity of grass species, including feather grass, meadow grass, clover, goldenrod, blades, eagle fern, thistle, field horsetail, and others.",

It is located in the southwestern part of the country, more precisely in the northwestern end of the Rila-Rhodope mountain massif.The vast dome of Rila rises above the surrounding mountain basins on all sides – the Samokov Basin (to the north), Kostenechko-Dolnobansko Basin (to the northeast), Dupnitsa Basin (to the northwest), Blagoevgrad Basin (to the southwest), and Razlog Basin (to the south). Rila is connected to the surrounding mountains through five passes – to the north, the Borovets Pass (1305 m) connects it to the ridges of Shipochan and Shumnatica in the Ihtimanska Sredna Gora, to the southeast, the Yundola Pass (1375 m) and Avramova Saddle (1295 m) connect it to the Rhodopes, to the south, the Predela Pass (1140 m) connects it to Pirin, and to the northwest, the Klissura Pass (1025 m) connects it to Vitosha. It borders the valleys of the following rivers: to the north and northeast – Maritsa, to the southeast – Yadenitsa, Dreshtenets, and Mesta, to the south – Gradevska, and to the west – Struma. Within these borders, Rila covers an area of 2629 km2.",
                Climate = "Rila has a typical mountain climate. On Mount Musala (2925 m), annual precipitation reaches 2000 mm, with 80% of it being snow. The lowest temperatures for the mountain were recorded there - the absolute minimum temperature is -31.2 \u00b0C with an average monthly temperature of -11.6 \u00b0C, measured in February. The absolute maximum temperature is 18.7 \u00b0C. Negative temperatures persist for about 9 months on average, often lasting until the end of June. A consistent rise in temperature is observed towards the middle and end of July. However, even during the summer months, the temperature does not stay permanently above 10 \u00b0C. From 5 to 10 days in June, July, and August have an average temperature above 15 \u00b0C. This defines the short growing season in the high mountain areas, varying from 3 to 6 months, lasting around 3 months above 2000 meters above sea level.\r\n\r\nIn the high parts of Rila, the relative humidity is most often between 80 and 85%. The driest months are the cold winter months. Humidity varies for the northern and southern slopes of Rila. On the southern slopes of the mountain, winter precipitation reaches 22 – 25% of the annual norm, while on the northern slopes, it is lower. On the western and northern slopes, the maximum precipitation occurs in spring and summer, while on the eastern slopes, it is in winter.\r\n\r\nA permanent snow cover in areas immediately above 1000 m above sea level is observed after December 10 – 15 for the northern slopes, and after December 20 – 30 for the southern slopes. The snow cover persists for an average of 200 – 220 days per year, with the thickest cover in the low zone of the mountain being in February when the average monthly thickness reaches 20 – 30 cm. In the high zone – above 2000 m above sea level – the snow cover is thickest in March – 70 – 80 cm. In the highest parts, the maximum snow cover thickness reaches 200 – 240 cm. The average duration of the period with a stable snow cover is 70 – 80 days at an altitude of 1200 – 1300 m, and at an altitude above 2000 m, it reaches 180 – 200 days. Wind speeds of 30 – 40 m/s (over 100 km/h), mainly from the southwest and west, are not uncommon. Northwestern and northeastern winds are more moderate. The average monthly wind speed on the highest mountain peaks reaches 11 – 12 m/s. In the lower parts, the average monthly speed ranges from 1.2 to 2.5 m/s, and in the middle elevation zone, it ranges from 2.5 – 3.2 m/s.",
                Waters = "Some of the most abundant and longest rivers in the Balkans originate from the mountain – Iskar, Maritsa, and Mesta. The sources of many tributaries of these rivers, as well as tributaries of Struma, are also located in the high mountainous parts of Rila – Beli, Levi, Prav, and Cherni Iskar, Byala and Cherni Mesta, and the rivers Belishka, Blagoevgradska Bistritsa, Gradevska, and Rilska. About 10% of the water resources of Struma and Mesta, over 5% of those of the Maritsa River, and more than 8% of the Iskar River are formed on the territory of the mountain.\r\n\r\nThe rivers originating from Rila are characterized by a predominantly snow-rain regime. They record the highest average annual runoff module for Bulgaria – 14.23 l/s/km2, reaching up to 40 l/s/km2 in the high parts of the mountain. Their full flow depends largely on rainfall and snowmelt, especially in the higher parts of the mountain where they are most abundant. Based on seasonal changes in precipitation, rivers originating from the mountain are characterized by spring-summer high flows and autumn-winter low flows. In the highland areas during winter, they are mainly nourished by underground waters due to the prolonged retention of snow cover and low temperatures. This leads to the occurrence of winter low flows, and for this reason, the monthly minimum runoff is observed in February. For the mid-high parts of Rila, this minimum is recorded in September. Spring flooding in the Rila mountain is caused by snowmelt and an increase in precipitation during this season. In the plains and lowland areas, numerous river arrivals are observed during this period, which are also elements of the river regime. The maximum runoff in the middle parts of the mountain occurs in April, while the monthly maximum runoff in the highland areas is recorded in May.\r\n\r\nOn the territory of Rila, the Rilska River flows, which is a left tributary of the Struma River and originates from the Fish Lakes in Rila. It is recognized as a border between three parts of the Rila mountain – Northwestern, Central, and Southwestern. In its lower course, being the Bulgarian-Ottoman border from 1878 to 1912, the river is the northern border of the historical-geographical region of Macedonia. Due to the glacial activity during the Quaternary period in the high mountainous parts of Rila, a large number of glacial lakes have formed. The majority of these lakes are permanent, with around 35 being temporary, and they are characterized by small surface areas and volumes. Typically situated at altitudes between 2000 and 2600 meters, they commonly occupy the bottoms of cirques, cirque terraces, and trog valleys. These lakes usually have a rounded or elliptical shape with small lengths and widths, and most of them have an area of less than 10 hectares.\r\n\r\nThe significance of these waters lies not only in their quantity but also in their quality and the beauty of the lakes, attracting thousands of tourists annually. The Seven Rila Lakes chain is the longest, most picturesque, and most visited lake group. In Rila, approximately 233 lakes have been described, with 189 being cirque lakes, and the rest having tectonic or landslide origins. The largest is Smradlivoto Lake, stretching over 212 hectares, ranking first in this aspect among all glacial lakes in the Balkans. The longest is Gornoto Ribno Lake with a length of 801 meters.\r\n\r\nMost lakes have an average depth of 2-5 meters, with the deepest being Okoto Lake at 37.5 meters, one of the Seven Rila Lakes. The highest lake is Ledenoto Lake (Lednik) at an elevation of 2715 meters, while the lowest is Suhoto Lake, located in Eastern Rila at an altitude of 2045 meters. Many lakes are grouped together, often draining into one another – such as the Seven Rila Lakes, Urdinite Lakes, Musalenski Lakes, Yakorudski Lakes, Ribni Lakes, and others.\r\n\r\nIn Rila, there are also lesser-known lakes like Vapski, Gruncharski, Djendemski, Kazanski (Kazanchalski), Manastirski, Marichini, Ropalishki, Skalishki (Redzhepski), and Chernopolyanski (Karaalanishki) lakes. Some of them, like Panichishte in Northwestern Rila, have a tectonic origin, formed during the subsidence of parts of the Earth's surface through faults and flexures. \r\n\r\n \r\nIn the valley of the Beli Iskar River, the Beli Iskar Dam has been constructed, supplying part of Sofia with drinking water. The reservoir's waters are also utilized for the generation of electrical energy. Another significant reservoir is the Belmeken Dam, located in the Sestrima River basin, part of the Belmeken-Sestrimo-Chaira cascade. Its dam wall stands at an elevation of 2000 meters, making it the highest dam with an embankment wall on the Balkan Peninsula. Categorized for both commercial and recreational fishing, it is connected to the Chaira Dam situated below it, with a drop of 700 meters between them. The Chaira Dam houses the PAVEC Chaira, an underground hydroelectric power plant, and is the largest pump-storage power plant in Southeastern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Kalin Dam, positioned at an elevation of 2394 meters, holds the title of the highest-altitude dam in Bulgaria and the Balkans. It supplies water to high-altitude hydropower plants within the Rila Cascade – PAVEC Kalin and HPPs Kamenez, Pastra, and Rila. Kalin Dam and the lower-lying Karagol Dam, situated beneath it, are interconnected with a water drop of 740 meters. \r\n\r\n The mineral waters in Rila are primarily associated with the deep fault structures of the Earth's crust. Hot mineral springs emerge at the foothills of the mountain, with the most famous one located in Sapareva Banya. The water springs out in the form of a geyser with a maximum temperature of 101.4 \u00b0C. This is the hottest spring in Bulgaria and the only geyser in the Balkans. Mineral springs are also found in Blagoevgrad, Razlog, Dolna Banya, the village of Banya, Osenovo, and others.\r\n\r\nThe region of Kostenets is rich in mineral springs with temperatures ranging from 47 to 73 \u00b0C. The waters here are weakly mineralized, with a small amount of radon and very low hardness. The springs have been known since ancient times, and remnants of Roman baths and balneological facilities are still preserved.\r\n\r\nIn the municipality of Samokov, the thermal-mineral spring \"Belchin Bani\" was tapped in 1932. The water from this spring has a temperature of 37 \u00b0C and a flow rate of 8 l/s.",

Thirteen invertebrate species in the region are globally endangered, while 41 species are included in global and European lists of endangered species.\r\n\r\nFish:\r\nThere are 5 species of fish in Rila, although different sources indicate that the diversity of fish species reaches up to 18, with 4 of them being Balkan endemics. Brown trout and Balkan trout inhabit the lakes, reservoirs, and occasionally the Maritsa, Ibër, Kriva River, and Dzheman rivers. The lakes in Rila are widely populated by bleak, introduced for fishing. Some lakes are stocked with grayling. Chub is less common, mainly found in the Cherni Iskar River. Endemic species in Rila include the Balkan gudgeon (Cottus gobio haemusi), the Struma loach (Nemacheilus angorae bureschi), the Maritsa barbel (Barbus cyclolepis), and the Balkan spirlin (Sabanejewia aurata balcanica).\r\n\r\nAmphibians and Reptiles:\r\nThe mountain is home to 20 species of amphibians and reptiles. Species found in the highest parts of the mountain include the Alpine newt, common toad, slowworm, viviparous lizard, meadow lizard, European green lizard, and European adder. The Macedonian rock lizard is an endemic species.\r\n\r\nBirds:\r\nNinety-nine species of birds (approximately 25% of Bulgaria's ornithofauna) are present in Rila, with the most numerous populations of capercaillie, hazel grouse, and rock partridge. Some of the most vibrant populations of birds of prey are also found here. Endangered bird species from the Red List, such as the Egyptian vulture, peregrine falcon, Eurasian three-toed woodpecker, white-backed woodpecker, black woodpecker, lesser spotted eagle, short-toed snake eagle, goshawk, snake eagle, and others, can be observed in the region. Nine bird species have ceased nesting here.",

Many of these plants are rare and protected, such as the well-known edelweiss, which is mostly found on the Djendema rocks beneath Vihren Peak.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation is vertically zoned into three altitude belts – forest, subalpine, and alpine. The forest belt is mainly occupied by coniferous trees such as white and black pine, white and black spruce, fir, and common spruce, reaching approximately 2000 meters. From there up to 2500 meters, the subalpine belt dominates, characterized by shrubs like dwarf pine and juniper, whose sizes decrease with increasing altitude. Finally, the alpine belt consists of grasses, lichens, and mosses, with an abundance of black crowberry at the boundary between the two. The vegetation around water basins is unique, often featuring representatives of the ostrich fern genus. The most famous tree in Pirin is the Baykusheva Mura, named after its discoverer, the forester Kosta Baykushev.

In the Western Rhodopes, the Mediterranean influence is weaker, while in the Eastern Rhodopes, it is stronger, as evidenced by the average annual temperatures and annual precipitation sums for five meteorological stations: Velingrad 9 \u00b0C, 550 mm; Smolyan 8.5 \u00b0C, 981 mm; Zlatograd 10.9 \u00b0C, 986 mm; Kardzhali 12.5 \u00b0C, 663 mm; Ivaylovgrad 12.7 \u00b0C, 736 mm.

The entire mountain falls within the watershed of the White Sea, with rivers originating and flowing through it either flowing into two main rivers (Maritsa and Mesta) or directly flowing into the Aegean Sea. In about 80% of the mountain's territory, excluding its southwestern and southern parts, the drainage is directed towards the Maritsa River through its right tributaries: Chepinska River, Stara River, Vacha, Parvenetska River, Cherkizitsa, Mechka, Kayalika, Banska River, Harmanliiska River, Biserska River, Arda, Luda River, and others. The southwestern parts of the mountain belong to the watershed of the Mesta River and its left tributaries: Zlataritsa, Kanina, Chechka Bistritsa, Dospat, Dyavolska River, and others. In the southernmost parts of the Rhodopes (in Greek territory), rivers flow directly into the Aegean Sea – Varba, Sushitsa, Aksu, Turnava, and others.\r\n\r\nIn the high-altitude zone of the Western Rhodopes, the large amount of precipitation, prolonged snow cover, low evaporation, steep relief, and prevailing impermeable geological base contribute to a high drainage modulus (over 25 l/s/km2). In the middle-altitude zone of the area, due to less precipitation and stronger evaporation, the drainage modulus decreases to 10 – 15 l/s/km2. In the low-altitude zone and at the foot of the mountain slopes, at the border with the Upper Thracian Plain, its value is the smallest (2 – 3 l/s/km\u00b2) due to low precipitation, significant evaporation, low slope of the relief, and permeable geological base.\r\n\r\nIn the Eastern Rhodopes, the rivers have predominantly rain-snow feeding and a pronounced winter maximum flow. Due to significantly lower altitude, much stronger Mediterranean influence, exposure of the slopes, and, consequently, different evaporation and different permeability of the geological base, the drainage modulus of the rivers in the Eastern Rhodopes fluctuates within quite wide limits, ranging from 5 to 25 l/s/km\u00b2.\r\n\r\nMost of the rivers in the Rhodopes flow through deep canyon valleys, which is a prerequisite for the construction of hydrotechnical facilities and the utilization of their significant water and energy resources. Some of the largest Bulgarian and Greek reservoirs are built in the mountain: Dospat, Shiroka Polyana, Batak, Golyam Beglik, Vacha, Krichim, Tsankov Kamak, Kurdzhali, Studen Kladenets, Ivaylovgrad, Chereshovsko Ezero (Limni Tisavru), Olesko Ezero (Limni Platanovrisis), and many others smaller ones.",

In the lower parts of the Eastern Rhodopes, forests give way to sub-Mediterranean low shrub species such as evergreen oak, heather, hornbeam, wild pear, boxwood, and red juniper.\r\n\r\nAt elevations above 800 meters, forests predominantly consist of common oak, oriental beech, hornbeam, ash, maple, and lime. In the coniferous belt, mainly found in the Western Rhodopes, common spruce, white pine, black pine, and beech are prevalent. At higher elevations, shrub vegetation and alpine meadows dominate.

These animals inhabit and reproduce in the dense pine, beech, and oak forests. The most significant mammal here is the brown bear, listed in the Red Book of endangered vertebrate animals in Greece.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that 25-30 bears live in the Central Rhodopes, considering the forests in the region as an ideal habitat. The wild goat is found on the steepest slopes in the Rhodopes, particularly in the Frakto area.

Other notable glaciers include Yamunotri, Zemu, and Khumbu. In Kashmir, the lower limit of glaciers is 2500 m, and in the Central Himalayas, it is 4000 m. Generally, glaciers are more developed in the western parts of the Himalayas. In the west, the snow line height on the southern slopes is 5000 m, on the northern slopes it is 5700 – 5900 m, while in the east, it is 4500 – 4800 m on the southern slopes and 6100 m on the northern slopes. Glaciers are primarily of dendritic (Himalayan) type, descending to 1300 – 1600 m along the snow line. Turkistan-type glaciers are also present, having small firn basins compared to areas with lateral glacial channels, primarily sustained by avalanches and lateral hanging glaciers. The northern slopes are characterized by giant accumulations of firn ice, covering many peaks entirely.\r\n\r\nThe higher parts of the Himalayas are covered with snow year-round, despite their proximity to the tropics. They give rise to several major rivers, converging into two main river systems:\r\n\r\nThe western rivers form the Indus Basin, with the largest river being the Indus. Originating from Tibet on Chinese territory, it flows southwest through India and Pakistan to the Arabian Sea. The main rivers in the Indus system are Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Bias, and Sutlej.\r\nMost of the remaining Himalayan rivers are part of the Ganges-Brahmaputra Basin. The two main rivers are the Ganges and the Brahmaputra. While the Ganges flows in the plains to the south of the Himalayas, the Brahmaputra originates in Tibet, flows east, then swings around the eastern Himalayas from the east, again changes its direction to the west through Assam, and finally merges with the Ganges in the Bay of Bengal, forming a common delta. Overall, the river system is more developed on their southern slopes. In their upper reaches, the rivers have snow and glacier-fed discharge with sharp fluctuations in flow over a 24-hour period, featuring narrow and deep valleys and numerous rapids and waterfalls. In the middle and lower reaches, rainfall predominates, with maximum flow during the dry season.\r\nHundreds of lakes are found in the Himalayas, with most situated at altitudes below 5000 m",

Along the eastern foothills of the mountain, extending from the Jamuna River Valley, lies the swampy strip of the Terai—a wooded and shrubby jungle featuring soap trees, mimosas, palms, bamboo, bananas, mangoes, all thriving on black clayey soils. Moving upward, up to 1000 – 1200 m on the windward slopes and along river valleys, there are evergreen humid tropical forests composed of palms, pandanus, laurel trees, tree ferns, bamboo, lianas (up to 400 species), and more. Above 1200 m in the west and 1500 m in the east, the zone of evergreen broad-leaved forests is situated, consisting of various species of oak, magnolia, and above 2200 m, deciduous (spruce, walnut, birch, maple) and coniferous (Himalayan cedar, blue pine, silver fir) forests from the temperate zone appear. These are accompanied by mosses and lichens covering the soil and tree trunks. At an altitude of 2700 – 3600 m, coniferous forests of silver fir, hemlock, spruce, juniper, etc., dominate, with a dense understory of rhododendrons. The lower part of the forest zone is characterized by red soils, while higher up, brown forest soils predominate. In the subalpine zone, small juniper-rhododendron groves are developed. The upper limit of alpine meadows is around 5000 m, although certain plants (such as Arenaria and edelweiss) are found even above 6000 m.",

The climate, vegetation, and wildlife vary in different parts or zones of the mountain.\r\n\r\nThe zone above 3000 m is called the \"glacier snow zone\" (firn). This area, with the coldest climate, is constantly covered with compacted snow.\r\nThe alpine tundra is located at an altitude between 2000 and 3000 m. This zone is warmer than the firn zone, and wildflowers and grasses can be found here.\r\nImmediately below is the subalpine zone, from 1500 to 2000 m in altitude. As temperatures gradually rise, coniferous forests of spruce and fir begin to appear.\r\nAt an altitude of about 1000 to 1500 m, there is arable land. Oak forests are widespread in this area, and it is also a place for agricultural production.\r\nBelow 1000 m are the lowlands. Here, a much greater variety of plants can be found. Human settlements are also in the lowlands, as the temperature is more tolerable for both people and animals.\r\n\r\nThe Alps serve as an important climatic dividing line in Europe. To the north and west of the range are areas with a temperate climate, while to the south, there are subtropical Mediterranean landscapes. Windward western and northwestern slopes receive 1500 to 2000 mm of precipitation, sometimes up to 4000 mm per year. The Alps are the source of several major rivers (Rhine, Rhone, Po, Adige, right tributaries of the Danube), as well as numerous lakes of glacial and tectonic-glacial origin (Lake Constance, Lake Geneva, Lake Como, Lake Maggiore, and others).\r\n\r\nThe altitude zonation of landscapes is clearly expressed. Up to an altitude of 800 meters, the climate is moderately warm, and on the southern slopes, it is Mediterranean, with many vineyards, gardens, and fields, as well as Mediterranean shrubs and broad-leaved forests. At altitudes from 800 to 1800 m, the climate is moderate, humid, with broad-leaved forests of oak and beech, gradually replaced by pine forests. At an altitude of 2200 to 2300 m, the climate is cold, with long-lasting snow cover (the so-called subalpine zone). Shrubs, meadows with tall grasses, and summer pastures predominate. Higher up, to the permanent snow line, is the so-called alpine zone with a cold climate and low-turf alpine meadows, which are covered with snow for most of the year. Even higher is the nival zone with glaciers, snow fields, and rocky slopes.",

The natural elevation limit of vegetation is determined by predominant broad-leaved species such as oak, beech, ash, and maple. They do not reach the same level, nor are they frequently found together, but their upper limit corresponds fairly accurately to the change from a temperate to a colder climate, as further evidenced by the change in grassy vegetation. This limit is usually around 1200 meters above sea level on the northern side of the Alps, while on the southern slopes, it often rises to 1500 meters, sometimes even up to 1700 meters.\r\n\r\nThis region is not always marked by the presence of characteristic trees. Human intervention has almost destroyed them in many areas, and except for the beech forests in the Austrian Alps, broad-leaved forests are rarely encountered. In many regions where such forests once existed, they are now replaced by white pine and spruce, which are more resistant to damage from goats, the greatest enemies of such trees.\r\n\r\nAbove the forests, small groups of juniper are often found, which in turn are replaced by shrubs, usually Rhododendron ferrugineum (on more acidic soils) or Rhododendron hirsutum (on more alkaline soils). Above them are alpine meadows, and higher up, vegetation becomes increasingly sparse. Several plant species have been recorded in the Alps above 4000 meters, including Ranunculus glacialis (glacier buttercup), Androsace Alpina, and Saxifraga biflora.\r\n\r\nIn the Alpine region, scientists identify 13,000 plant species. Alpine plants are grouped by habitat type and soil, which can be limestone or not. Plants thrive in various environmental conditions: from meadows, swamps, forests (broad-leaved and coniferous) and areas unaffected by avalanches and landslides, to rocks and ridges.\r\n\r\nOne of the most well-known mountain plants is the glacier buttercup, which holds the record for the highest-growing plant at 4200 meters. Small groups of plants are found at an altitude of 2800 meters. Many of them, such as Eritrichium and Lychnis, have a specific form that protects them from herbivores living at these altitudes and from moisture loss. In this way, young shoots are protected from wind and cold. The famous edelweiss is covered with a layer of white hairs that successfully retain warmth.",

Only a few bird species remain in the mountains throughout the year. There are birds living in the Alps that have fully adapted to the inhospitable environment. For example, the Alpine chough builds nests in the cracks of rocks above the tree line and searches for food (seeds and insects) on the mountain slopes. The yellow-billed chough also nests on the rocks well above the tree line. During winter, it forms large flocks that gather around tourist centers and stations, where they primarily feed on waste. The alpine marmot is the most commonly encountered animal in the Alps. In addition to it, notable species include the golden eagle, alpine ibex, chamois, yellow-billed chough, snowfinch, bearded vulture, brown bear, lynx, noble deer, wolf, and rock ptarmigan. There are 14 national parks in the Alps dedicated to conserving alpine fauna.",

The southern part is rainy and cold, the Central Andes are dry, and the Northern Andes are typically rainy and warm, with an average temperature of 18 \u00b0C in Colombia. The climate here is notable for its drastic changes even over short distances – for example, rainforests (known as selva) exist only kilometers away from the snow-covered peak of Cotopaxi.\r\n\r\nThe mountains have a significant effect on the temperature of the surrounding areas. The snow line varies depending on the location – typically between 4500 – 4800 m in the tropical parts of Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, and Northern Peru; it increases to 4800 – 5200 m in the dry mountainous areas of southern Peru and the northern part of Chile to the south; and then descends – gradually to 4500 m at Mount Aconcagua, 2000 m at 40\u00b0 south latitude, 500 m at 50\u00b0 south latitude, and barely 300 m in Tierra del Fuego. South of 50\u00b0 south latitude, some of the larger glaciers descend directly to sea level.\r\n\r\nThe precipitation reaches up to 3000 mm annually, with the most abundant rainfall on the western slopes of the Northern Andes (Andagoya station – 7140 mm of precipitation). Due to the equatorial climate in the foothills of the Northern Andes towards the Amazon basin and the Pacific Ocean, daily rainfall and high temperatures are characteristic.\r\n\r\nThe foothills of the Andes fall into the hot zone (tierra caliente), reaching up to 600 m in altitude. Above it is the temperate zone (tierra templada), reaching up to 2000 m in altitude. Up to 2800 m is the cold zone (tierra fria). Above 2800 m, there is a cold and semi-desert landscape.

In contrast to the humid parts of the Andean slopes, the relatively dry areas predominate in much of Western Peru, Chile, and Argentina. Together with several inland mountain valleys, these regions are typically dominated by broadleaf forests, shrubs, and vegetation extending to the extreme slopes near the Atacama Desert.\r\n\r\nThe soil-plant world of the Andes is extremely diverse, influenced by the high altitude of the mountains and the significant difference in moisture between the western and eastern slopes. The altitudinal zonation in the Andes is clearly expressed. Three zones are identified – tierra caliente, tierra fria, and tierra helada.\r\n\r\nIn the mountain red soils of the Venezuelan Andes, broadleaf (during the winter dry season) forests and shrubs thrive. The lower parts of the windward slopes from the Northwestern to the Central Andes are covered with mountainous humid equatorial and tropical forests, flourishing on lateritic soils (mountain vegetation), as well as mixed forests of evergreen and deciduous species. The appearance of equatorial forests in the mountains slightly differs from those in the continental plains; characteristic species include various palms, figs, bananas, cocoa trees, and others. At higher elevations (up to 2500 – 3000 m), the character of vegetation changes; bamboo, tree ferns, coca shrubs (source of cocaine), and quinine trees are typical. Between 3000 m and 3800 m, high-altitude vegetation with low trees and shrubs, epiphytes, and lianas are found, with bamboo, tree ferns, evergreen oaks representing Myrtle and Pyrene families. Higher up, mainly durable xerophytic vegetation dominates, paramo, numerous complex flowers; mosses on flat areas and lifeless rocky spaces on the inclined slopes. Above 4500 m is the zone of eternal snow and ice.\r\n\r\nFurther south in the subtropical Chilean Andes, evergreen shrubs on brown soils are found. In the Elongated Valley, soils resembling chernozem in composition are present. The vegetation on the higher plateaus includes equatorial mountain meadows paramo to the north, high-altitude tropical steppes haloxerophytes east of Puno, desert-like vegetation (in the Atacama Desert – succulent vegetation and cacti) west of Puno and throughout the entire Pacific west between 5 – 28\u00b0 south latitude.",

The crepuscular (active during dawn and dusk) chinchillas, two threatened members of the rodent order, inhabit the Andes' alpine regions. The Andean condor, the largest bird of its kind in the Western Hemisphere, occurs throughout much of the Andes but generally in very low densities. Other animals found in the relatively open habitats of the high Andes include the huemul, cougar, foxes in the genus Pseudalopex,and, for birds, certain species of tinamous (notably members of the genus Nothoprocta), Andean goose, giant coot, flamingos (mainly associated with hypersaline lakes), lesser rhea, Andean flicker, diademed sandpiper-plover, miners, sierra-finches and diuca-finches.\r\n\r\nLake Titicaca hosts several endemics, among them the highly endangered Titicaca flightless grebe and Titicaca water frog.[35] A few species of hummingbirds, notably some hillstars, can be seen at altitudes above 4,000 m (13,100 ft), but far higher diversities can be found at lower altitudes, especially in the humid Andean forests (\"cloud forests\") growing on slopes in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and far northwestern Argentina. These forest-types, which includes the Yungas and parts of the Chocó, are very rich in flora and fauna, although few large mammals exist, exceptions being the threatened mountain tapir, spectacled bear and yellow-tailed woolly monkey.\r\n\r\nBirds of humid Andean forests include mountain toucans, quetzals and the Andean cock-of-the-rock, while mixed species flocks dominated by tanagers and furnariids commonly are seen – in contrast to several vocal but typically cryptic species of wrens, tapaculos and antpittas.\r\n\r\nA number of species such as the royal cinclodes and white-browed tit-spinetail are associated with Polylepis, and consequently also threatened.",

There are remnants of the former savanna vegetation with Acacia, Combretum, Terminalia and Grewia. Between 1,000 m (3,300 ft) and 1,800 m (5,900 ft), coffee appears as part of the \"Chagga home gardens\" agroforestry. Native vegetation at this altitude range (Strombosia, Newtonia, and Entandrophragma) is limited to inaccessible valleys and gorges[64] and is different from vegetation at higher altitudes. On the southern slope, montane forests first contain Ocotea usambarensis as well as ferns and epiphytes; farther up in cloud forests Podocarpus latifolius, Hagenia abyssinica and Erica excelsa grow, as well as fog-dependent mosses. On the drier northern slopes olive, Croton-Calodendrum, Cassipourea, and Juniperus form forests in order of increasing altitude. Between 3,100 m (10,200 ft) and 3,900 m (12,800 ft) lie Erica bush and heathlands, followed by Helichrysum, until 4,500 m (14,800 ft). Neophytes have been observed, including Poa annua.\r\n\r\nRecords from the Maundi crater at 2,780 m (9,120 ft) indicate that the vegetation of Kilimanjaro has varied over time. Forest vegetation retreated during the Last Glacial Maximum and the ericaceous vegetation belt lowered by 1,500 m (4,900 ft) between 42,000 and 30,000 years ago because of the drier and colder conditions.[64]\r\n\r\nThe Tussock Grassland is an area on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro that contains many unique species of vegetation, such as the water holding cabbage.[citation needed]",

Elephants and Cape buffaloes are among the animals that can be potentially hazardous to trekkers. Bushbucks, chameleons, dik-diks, duikers, mongooses, sunbirds, and warthogs have also been reported. Zebras, leopards and hyenas have been observed sporadically on the Shira plateau. Specific species associated with the mountain include the Kilimanjaro shrew and the chameleon Kinyongia tavetana.",
