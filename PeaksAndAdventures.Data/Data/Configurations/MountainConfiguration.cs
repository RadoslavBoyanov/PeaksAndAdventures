                    "Stara Planina is one of the four physiographic regions of the Old Mountain Zone. It is part of the Alpine-Himalayan mountain system, specifically within the large geological formation known as the Balkanides. Situated between the Fore-Balkans to the north and the Sub-Balkan valleys to the south, it extends to the west along the Targovishte Timok River (a right tributary of the Beli Timok) and the Visochitsa River (Komshitsa, Temska River, right tributary of the Nishava) in Serbia. To the east, it reaches the Black Sea at Cape Emine.\r\n\r\nStara Planina spans parts of 14 Bulgarian provinces: Vidin, Montana, Vratsa, Sofia, Sofia City, Lovech, Plovdiv, Gabrovo, Stara Zagora, Veliko Tarnovo, Sliven, Shumen, Burgas, and Varna.\r\n\r\nThe area of Stara Planina within Bulgaria is 11,596.4 km\u00b2, with a length of 530 km and a width ranging from 15 km in the central part to 50 km in the western and eastern parts. Its average elevation is 722 meters above sea level.",
                Climate = "The climate is moderately continental, with the exception of the eastern parts, which are subject to transitional continental influences.\r\n\r\nThe main Stara Planina mountain range falls under the mountain climate zone. The primary factors shaping the climate are atmospheric circulation, elevation, and the slopes' exposure.\r\n\r\nStara Planina serves as the main climatic barrier and natural border in Bulgaria. The northern foothills exhibit moderately continental climatic characteristics, while the southern ones are transitional. Climate transition is particularly characteristic of the eastern parts of the mountain. From the foothills to the summit, the character and values of climatic elements change. The average annual temperature decreases with elevation, reaching -0.7 \u00b0C at the Botev Peak station (Table 1). Average January temperatures vary widely, from around 0 \u00b0C in the easternmost parts to -5 \u00b0C for the Petrohan station and -9.3 \u00b0C for the Botev Peak station. Average July temperatures range from 8 to 20 \u00b0C, depending on the elevation. Temperature amplitudes are not large, ranging from 16 to 18 \u00b0C.\r\n\r\nPrecipitation increases with elevation, reaching 1200–1400 mm. It is more abundant on the northern slopes, while the southern slopes remain in a precipitation shadow, receiving about 550 mm of precipitation. In the easternmost parts, due to the transitional climate, precipitation reaches about 600 mm. Snow retention is about 4–6 weeks in higher areas and 1–2 weeks in the east. The maximum precipitation occurs in spring, while the minimum is in winter, with seasonal equalization of precipitation in the eastern parts. The windiest places in Bulgaria are the peaks of Murgash and Botev, where the average annual wind speed reaches 10 m/s. The northern foothills of Stara Planina are characterized by foehn phenomena, while the region of Tvarditsa and Sliven experiences the cold descending wind known as \"bora\" (often called \"Sliven wind\"). Adverse climatic phenomena include fog, temperature inversions in basins, and icy conditions.",
                Waters = "\r\nStara Planina gives rise to several significant rivers in Bulgaria, including Lom, Ogosta, Nishava, Malki Iskar, Vit, Osam, Vidima, Rositsa, Yantra, Stryama, Tundzha, Luda Kamchiya, and others. A substantial part of Bulgaria's river drainage is formed in this mountain range. The rivers exhibit characteristics of rain-snow, snow-rain, rain (especially in the eastern part), and karstic recharge (rivers Nishava, Iskretska River, Kotlenska River, Leva River, etc.). In the high-altitude areas, the peak of runoff occurs in May, while in the lower areas it is in April for the northern slope and March for the southern slope. In the Ludogorie River basin, the maximum is in February. Two tectonic lakes are also located here: \"Lokvata\" under Golyam Kupen in the Central Stara Planina and Skalenskoto in the Stidovska Planina.\r\n\r\nThe runoff module in the Stara Planina region shows significant diversity. It is higher in the high-altitude zone on the northern windward slopes (above 25 l/s/km\u00b2), where precipitation is more significant, snow retention is greater, and evaporation is less pronounced. Additionally, the maximum runoff is influenced by the impermeable geological foundation and the steep relief. In the lower zone, the runoff module is significantly smaller (10 l/s/km\u00b2), where lower precipitation amounts, less pronounced snow retention, and stronger evaporation greatly reduce its magnitude. In the lowest parts of Stara Planina, the module varies between 3 and 5 l/s/km\u00b2, and these values are due to low precipitation amounts, significant evaporation, substantial infiltration into the permeable geological foundation, and the slight slope of the relief.\r\n\r\nAmong the reservoirs, the largest is the Kamchiya Dam, built on the Ludog Kamchiya River. The rock composition characteristics allow the formation of significant amounts of fissure underground waters. The developed karst processes are also the cause of numerous karst springs. Some of the largest karst springs here are the Iskrets Springs, Zhitolyub near the Lakatnik station, the Opitsvet spring at the foot of Chepan and Mala Planina, the Kotelski springs, while the most famous mineral springs are in Vurshets, Bursiya (Berkovsko), Neshkovtsi (Troyansko), and others.\r\n\r\nNotable waterfalls include Raynskoto Praskalo (the highest permanent waterfall on the Balkan Peninsula), Golyam Dzhendemski Waterfall, Vidimskoto, Kademliyskoto, Babskoto, Karlovsko Praskalo, and others. The Vratsa Waterfall near Vratsa is the largest intermittent waterfall in the Balkans.",
                Flora = " Up to about 800 meters above sea level, broadleaf species prevail, mainly oak and hornbeam, above which is the belt of beech forests. In many places, it is the beech that forms the upper limit of the forest. Above the beech forests, in certain locations, there are beautiful spruce forests, sometimes mixed with fir (Berkovska and Kalofer mountain). Additionally, limited areas of forests of whitebeam (Teteven region) and black pine exist. On the northern slopes of Berkovska Stara Planina, there are natural groves of the relict common chestnut. In Central Stara Planina, on karst terrains, one can find the edelweiss (in the area of Kozata Stena and Mazalat peak).\r\n\r\nThe highest parts are covered with meadows and pastures. Among the shrub species, rosehip, hawthorn, blackberry, buckthorn, hazel, juniper, blueberry, heather, blackthorn, wild pear, wild plum, and others are widespread. In certain sections of Central and Western Stara Planina, heath communities are preserved. In the region of Aytos, the endemic Aytos grabiche can be found, while in the central parts of the mountain, the endemic Stara Planina pine is present. West of Sliven is the northernmost location of the Mediterranean species, kuckuch. There is a significant diversity of grass species, including feather grass, meadow grass, clover, goldenrod, blades, eagle fern, thistle, field horsetail, and others.",
                Fauna = "The main Stara Planina mountain range is inhabited by representatives of the Central European and Eurosiberian fauna, including wild goat, red deer, roe deer, bear, squirrel, wolf, fox, hare, hedgehog. Among the birds, there are eagles, alpine chough, woodpecker, thrush. Among the insects and amphibians, there are beetles, butterflies, grasshoppers, snails, cave animals, and some are endemic species, such as the beetle, the Alpine newt, and others.",
