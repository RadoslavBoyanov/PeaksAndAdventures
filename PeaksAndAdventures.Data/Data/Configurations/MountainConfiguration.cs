                    "Stara Planina is one of the four physiographic regions of the Old Mountain Zone. It is part of the Alpine-Himalayan mountain system, specifically within the large geological formation known as the Balkanides. Situated between the Fore-Balkans to the north and the Sub-Balkan valleys to the south, it extends to the west along the Targovishte Timok River (a right tributary of the Beli Timok) and the Visochitsa River (Komshitsa, Temska River, right tributary of the Nishava) in Serbia. To the east, it reaches the Black Sea at Cape Emine.\r\n\r\nStara Planina spans parts of 14 Bulgarian provinces: Vidin, Montana, Vratsa, Sofia, Sofia City, Lovech, Plovdiv, Gabrovo, Stara Zagora, Veliko Tarnovo, Sliven, Shumen, Burgas, and Varna.\r\n\r\nThe area of Stara Planina within Bulgaria is 11,596.4 km\u00b2, with a length of 530 km and a width ranging from 15 km in the central part to 50 km in the western and eastern parts. Its average elevation is 722 meters above sea level.",
                Climate = "The climate is moderately continental, with the exception of the eastern parts, which are subject to transitional continental influences.\r\n\r\nThe main Stara Planina mountain range falls under the mountain climate zone. The primary factors shaping the climate are atmospheric circulation, elevation, and the slopes' exposure.\r\n\r\nStara Planina serves as the main climatic barrier and natural border in Bulgaria. The northern foothills exhibit moderately continental climatic characteristics, while the southern ones are transitional. Climate transition is particularly characteristic of the eastern parts of the mountain. From the foothills to the summit, the character and values of climatic elements change. The average annual temperature decreases with elevation, reaching -0.7 \u00b0C at the Botev Peak station (Table 1). Average January temperatures vary widely, from around 0 \u00b0C in the easternmost parts to -5 \u00b0C for the Petrohan station and -9.3 \u00b0C for the Botev Peak station. Average July temperatures range from 8 to 20 \u00b0C, depending on the elevation. Temperature amplitudes are not large, ranging from 16 to 18 \u00b0C.\r\n\r\nPrecipitation increases with elevation, reaching 1200–1400 mm. It is more abundant on the northern slopes, while the southern slopes remain in a precipitation shadow, receiving about 550 mm of precipitation. In the easternmost parts, due to the transitional climate, precipitation reaches about 600 mm. Snow retention is about 4–6 weeks in higher areas and 1–2 weeks in the east. The maximum precipitation occurs in spring, while the minimum is in winter, with seasonal equalization of precipitation in the eastern parts. The windiest places in Bulgaria are the peaks of Murgash and Botev, where the average annual wind speed reaches 10 m/s. The northern foothills of Stara Planina are characterized by foehn phenomena, while the region of Tvarditsa and Sliven experiences the cold descending wind known as \"bora\" (often called \"Sliven wind\"). Adverse climatic phenomena include fog, temperature inversions in basins, and icy conditions.",
                Waters = "\r\nStara Planina gives rise to several significant rivers in Bulgaria, including Lom, Ogosta, Nishava, Malki Iskar, Vit, Osam, Vidima, Rositsa, Yantra, Stryama, Tundzha, Luda Kamchiya, and others. A substantial part of Bulgaria's river drainage is formed in this mountain range. The rivers exhibit characteristics of rain-snow, snow-rain, rain (especially in the eastern part), and karstic recharge (rivers Nishava, Iskretska River, Kotlenska River, Leva River, etc.). In the high-altitude areas, the peak of runoff occurs in May, while in the lower areas it is in April for the northern slope and March for the southern slope. In the Ludogorie River basin, the maximum is in February. Two tectonic lakes are also located here: \"Lokvata\" under Golyam Kupen in the Central Stara Planina and Skalenskoto in the Stidovska Planina.\r\n\r\nThe runoff module in the Stara Planina region shows significant diversity. It is higher in the high-altitude zone on the northern windward slopes (above 25 l/s/km\u00b2), where precipitation is more significant, snow retention is greater, and evaporation is less pronounced. Additionally, the maximum runoff is influenced by the impermeable geological foundation and the steep relief. In the lower zone, the runoff module is significantly smaller (10 l/s/km\u00b2), where lower precipitation amounts, less pronounced snow retention, and stronger evaporation greatly reduce its magnitude. In the lowest parts of Stara Planina, the module varies between 3 and 5 l/s/km\u00b2, and these values are due to low precipitation amounts, significant evaporation, substantial infiltration into the permeable geological foundation, and the slight slope of the relief.\r\n\r\nAmong the reservoirs, the largest is the Kamchiya Dam, built on the Ludog Kamchiya River. The rock composition characteristics allow the formation of significant amounts of fissure underground waters. The developed karst processes are also the cause of numerous karst springs. Some of the largest karst springs here are the Iskrets Springs, Zhitolyub near the Lakatnik station, the Opitsvet spring at the foot of Chepan and Mala Planina, the Kotelski springs, while the most famous mineral springs are in Vurshets, Bursiya (Berkovsko), Neshkovtsi (Troyansko), and others.\r\n\r\nNotable waterfalls include Raynskoto Praskalo (the highest permanent waterfall on the Balkan Peninsula), Golyam Dzhendemski Waterfall, Vidimskoto, Kademliyskoto, Babskoto, Karlovsko Praskalo, and others. The Vratsa Waterfall near Vratsa is the largest intermittent waterfall in the Balkans.",
                Flora = " Up to about 800 meters above sea level, broadleaf species prevail, mainly oak and hornbeam, above which is the belt of beech forests. In many places, it is the beech that forms the upper limit of the forest. Above the beech forests, in certain locations, there are beautiful spruce forests, sometimes mixed with fir (Berkovska and Kalofer mountain). Additionally, limited areas of forests of whitebeam (Teteven region) and black pine exist. On the northern slopes of Berkovska Stara Planina, there are natural groves of the relict common chestnut. In Central Stara Planina, on karst terrains, one can find the edelweiss (in the area of Kozata Stena and Mazalat peak).\r\n\r\nThe highest parts are covered with meadows and pastures. Among the shrub species, rosehip, hawthorn, blackberry, buckthorn, hazel, juniper, blueberry, heather, blackthorn, wild pear, wild plum, and others are widespread. In certain sections of Central and Western Stara Planina, heath communities are preserved. In the region of Aytos, the endemic Aytos grabiche can be found, while in the central parts of the mountain, the endemic Stara Planina pine is present. West of Sliven is the northernmost location of the Mediterranean species, kuckuch. There is a significant diversity of grass species, including feather grass, meadow grass, clover, goldenrod, blades, eagle fern, thistle, field horsetail, and others.",

It is located in the southwestern part of the country, more precisely in the northwestern end of the Rila-Rhodope mountain massif.The vast dome of Rila rises above the surrounding mountain basins on all sides – the Samokov Basin (to the north), Kostenechko-Dolnobansko Basin (to the northeast), Dupnitsa Basin (to the northwest), Blagoevgrad Basin (to the southwest), and Razlog Basin (to the south). Rila is connected to the surrounding mountains through five passes – to the north, the Borovets Pass (1305 m) connects it to the ridges of Shipochan and Shumnatica in the Ihtimanska Sredna Gora, to the southeast, the Yundola Pass (1375 m) and Avramova Saddle (1295 m) connect it to the Rhodopes, to the south, the Predela Pass (1140 m) connects it to Pirin, and to the northwest, the Klissura Pass (1025 m) connects it to Vitosha. It borders the valleys of the following rivers: to the north and northeast – Maritsa, to the southeast – Yadenitsa, Dreshtenets, and Mesta, to the south – Gradevska, and to the west – Struma. Within these borders, Rila covers an area of 2629 km2.",
                Climate = "Rila has a typical mountain climate. On Mount Musala (2925 m), annual precipitation reaches 2000 mm, with 80% of it being snow. The lowest temperatures for the mountain were recorded there - the absolute minimum temperature is -31.2 \u00b0C with an average monthly temperature of -11.6 \u00b0C, measured in February. The absolute maximum temperature is 18.7 \u00b0C. Negative temperatures persist for about 9 months on average, often lasting until the end of June. A consistent rise in temperature is observed towards the middle and end of July. However, even during the summer months, the temperature does not stay permanently above 10 \u00b0C. From 5 to 10 days in June, July, and August have an average temperature above 15 \u00b0C. This defines the short growing season in the high mountain areas, varying from 3 to 6 months, lasting around 3 months above 2000 meters above sea level.\r\n\r\nIn the high parts of Rila, the relative humidity is most often between 80 and 85%. The driest months are the cold winter months. Humidity varies for the northern and southern slopes of Rila. On the southern slopes of the mountain, winter precipitation reaches 22 – 25% of the annual norm, while on the northern slopes, it is lower. On the western and northern slopes, the maximum precipitation occurs in spring and summer, while on the eastern slopes, it is in winter.\r\n\r\nA permanent snow cover in areas immediately above 1000 m above sea level is observed after December 10 – 15 for the northern slopes, and after December 20 – 30 for the southern slopes. The snow cover persists for an average of 200 – 220 days per year, with the thickest cover in the low zone of the mountain being in February when the average monthly thickness reaches 20 – 30 cm. In the high zone – above 2000 m above sea level – the snow cover is thickest in March – 70 – 80 cm. In the highest parts, the maximum snow cover thickness reaches 200 – 240 cm. The average duration of the period with a stable snow cover is 70 – 80 days at an altitude of 1200 – 1300 m, and at an altitude above 2000 m, it reaches 180 – 200 days. Wind speeds of 30 – 40 m/s (over 100 km/h), mainly from the southwest and west, are not uncommon. Northwestern and northeastern winds are more moderate. The average monthly wind speed on the highest mountain peaks reaches 11 – 12 m/s. In the lower parts, the average monthly speed ranges from 1.2 to 2.5 m/s, and in the middle elevation zone, it ranges from 2.5 – 3.2 m/s.",
                Waters = "Some of the most abundant and longest rivers in the Balkans originate from the mountain – Iskar, Maritsa, and Mesta. The sources of many tributaries of these rivers, as well as tributaries of Struma, are also located in the high mountainous parts of Rila – Beli, Levi, Prav, and Cherni Iskar, Byala and Cherni Mesta, and the rivers Belishka, Blagoevgradska Bistritsa, Gradevska, and Rilska. About 10% of the water resources of Struma and Mesta, over 5% of those of the Maritsa River, and more than 8% of the Iskar River are formed on the territory of the mountain.\r\n\r\nThe rivers originating from Rila are characterized by a predominantly snow-rain regime. They record the highest average annual runoff module for Bulgaria – 14.23 l/s/km2, reaching up to 40 l/s/km2 in the high parts of the mountain. Their full flow depends largely on rainfall and snowmelt, especially in the higher parts of the mountain where they are most abundant. Based on seasonal changes in precipitation, rivers originating from the mountain are characterized by spring-summer high flows and autumn-winter low flows. In the highland areas during winter, they are mainly nourished by underground waters due to the prolonged retention of snow cover and low temperatures. This leads to the occurrence of winter low flows, and for this reason, the monthly minimum runoff is observed in February. For the mid-high parts of Rila, this minimum is recorded in September. Spring flooding in the Rila mountain is caused by snowmelt and an increase in precipitation during this season. In the plains and lowland areas, numerous river arrivals are observed during this period, which are also elements of the river regime. The maximum runoff in the middle parts of the mountain occurs in April, while the monthly maximum runoff in the highland areas is recorded in May.\r\n\r\nOn the territory of Rila, the Rilska River flows, which is a left tributary of the Struma River and originates from the Fish Lakes in Rila. It is recognized as a border between three parts of the Rila mountain – Northwestern, Central, and Southwestern. In its lower course, being the Bulgarian-Ottoman border from 1878 to 1912, the river is the northern border of the historical-geographical region of Macedonia. Due to the glacial activity during the Quaternary period in the high mountainous parts of Rila, a large number of glacial lakes have formed. The majority of these lakes are permanent, with around 35 being temporary, and they are characterized by small surface areas and volumes. Typically situated at altitudes between 2000 and 2600 meters, they commonly occupy the bottoms of cirques, cirque terraces, and trog valleys. These lakes usually have a rounded or elliptical shape with small lengths and widths, and most of them have an area of less than 10 hectares.\r\n\r\nThe significance of these waters lies not only in their quantity but also in their quality and the beauty of the lakes, attracting thousands of tourists annually. The Seven Rila Lakes chain is the longest, most picturesque, and most visited lake group. In Rila, approximately 233 lakes have been described, with 189 being cirque lakes, and the rest having tectonic or landslide origins. The largest is Smradlivoto Lake, stretching over 212 hectares, ranking first in this aspect among all glacial lakes in the Balkans. The longest is Gornoto Ribno Lake with a length of 801 meters.\r\n\r\nMost lakes have an average depth of 2-5 meters, with the deepest being Okoto Lake at 37.5 meters, one of the Seven Rila Lakes. The highest lake is Ledenoto Lake (Lednik) at an elevation of 2715 meters, while the lowest is Suhoto Lake, located in Eastern Rila at an altitude of 2045 meters. Many lakes are grouped together, often draining into one another – such as the Seven Rila Lakes, Urdinite Lakes, Musalenski Lakes, Yakorudski Lakes, Ribni Lakes, and others.\r\n\r\nIn Rila, there are also lesser-known lakes like Vapski, Gruncharski, Djendemski, Kazanski (Kazanchalski), Manastirski, Marichini, Ropalishki, Skalishki (Redzhepski), and Chernopolyanski (Karaalanishki) lakes. Some of them, like Panichishte in Northwestern Rila, have a tectonic origin, formed during the subsidence of parts of the Earth's surface through faults and flexures. \r\n\r\n \r\nIn the valley of the Beli Iskar River, the Beli Iskar Dam has been constructed, supplying part of Sofia with drinking water. The reservoir's waters are also utilized for the generation of electrical energy. Another significant reservoir is the Belmeken Dam, located in the Sestrima River basin, part of the Belmeken-Sestrimo-Chaira cascade. Its dam wall stands at an elevation of 2000 meters, making it the highest dam with an embankment wall on the Balkan Peninsula. Categorized for both commercial and recreational fishing, it is connected to the Chaira Dam situated below it, with a drop of 700 meters between them. The Chaira Dam houses the PAVEC Chaira, an underground hydroelectric power plant, and is the largest pump-storage power plant in Southeastern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Kalin Dam, positioned at an elevation of 2394 meters, holds the title of the highest-altitude dam in Bulgaria and the Balkans. It supplies water to high-altitude hydropower plants within the Rila Cascade – PAVEC Kalin and HPPs Kamenez, Pastra, and Rila. Kalin Dam and the lower-lying Karagol Dam, situated beneath it, are interconnected with a water drop of 740 meters. \r\n\r\n The mineral waters in Rila are primarily associated with the deep fault structures of the Earth's crust. Hot mineral springs emerge at the foothills of the mountain, with the most famous one located in Sapareva Banya. The water springs out in the form of a geyser with a maximum temperature of 101.4 \u00b0C. This is the hottest spring in Bulgaria and the only geyser in the Balkans. Mineral springs are also found in Blagoevgrad, Razlog, Dolna Banya, the village of Banya, Osenovo, and others.\r\n\r\nThe region of Kostenets is rich in mineral springs with temperatures ranging from 47 to 73 \u00b0C. The waters here are weakly mineralized, with a small amount of radon and very low hardness. The springs have been known since ancient times, and remnants of Roman baths and balneological facilities are still preserved.\r\n\r\nIn the municipality of Samokov, the thermal-mineral spring \"Belchin Bani\" was tapped in 1932. The water from this spring has a temperature of 37 \u00b0C and a flow rate of 8 l/s.",

                Fauna = "\r\nIn Rila, a total of 24 species of animals are listed in the World Red List. Among vertebrate animals, there are 172 species, with 121 of them listed in the Bulgarian Red List, 15 in the European Red List, 24 in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, and 158 in the lists of the Bern Convention.\r\n\r\nInvertebrates:\r\nIn Rila, there are 2934 species of invertebrates, with 242 being endemic species and subspecies. Thirteen invertebrate species in the region are globally endangered, while 41 species are included in global and European lists of endangered species.\r\n\r\nFish:\r\nThere are 5 species of fish in Rila, although different sources indicate that the diversity of fish species reaches up to 18, with 4 of them being Balkan endemics. Brown trout and Balkan trout inhabit the lakes, reservoirs, and occasionally the Maritsa, Ibër, Kriva River, and Dzheman rivers. The lakes in Rila are widely populated by bleak, introduced for fishing. Some lakes are stocked with grayling. Chub is less common, mainly found in the Cherni Iskar River. Endemic species in Rila include the Balkan gudgeon (Cottus gobio haemusi), the Struma loach (Nemacheilus angorae bureschi), the Maritsa barbel (Barbus cyclolepis), and the Balkan spirlin (Sabanejewia aurata balcanica).\r\n\r\nAmphibians and Reptiles:\r\nThe mountain is home to 20 species of amphibians and reptiles. Species found in the highest parts of the mountain include the Alpine newt, common toad, slowworm, viviparous lizard, meadow lizard, European green lizard, and European adder. The Macedonian rock lizard is an endemic species.\r\n\r\nBirds:\r\nNinety-nine species of birds (approximately 25% of Bulgaria's ornithofauna) are present in Rila, with the most numerous populations of capercaillie, hazel grouse, and rock partridge. Some of the most vibrant populations of birds of prey are also found here. Endangered bird species from the Red List, such as the Egyptian vulture, peregrine falcon, Eurasian three-toed woodpecker, white-backed woodpecker, black woodpecker, lesser spotted eagle, short-toed snake eagle, goshawk, snake eagle, and others, can be observed in the region. Nine bird species have ceased nesting here.",
